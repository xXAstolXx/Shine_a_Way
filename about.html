    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Game "SHINE A WAY" is a dark Platformer. The Player's Goal is to navigate and interact in a dark Laboratory with the usage of a light flare and to reveal the platforms to be able to use them. You are an electrician and just want to finish your job: fix the light in the laboratory, where creatures hide in the shadows. 
      Fix the power box at the end of the level and escape.
